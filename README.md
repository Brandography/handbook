# Development at Brandography
At Brandography, we have some of the best nerds around. We love [GIFs](https://media.giphy.com/media/tIjdrTgFkT3kig4DY0/giphy.gif), [dogs](https://cdnbrandog2-c7f.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Roufous-540x540-1.jpg), [tech news](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [beer](https://media1.giphy.com/media/4JOaSVSBUczAY/giphy.gif). If you're wondering what our developers do or might be interested in working on our team, here's how we work.

## Code Standards
Our team has collected some basic syntax tools and style guide references. We use these every day to build quality in our craft.

### Your Editor
Your integrated development environment (IDE) is a very personal part of you doing your best work. You know it like the back of your hand. We will never enforce a specific editor (but we love [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), terminal emulator, or operating system upon you (we prefer MacOS or Linux). You are free to set up your system to your liking.

#### `~/.editorconfig`
We won't enforce the editor you choose to use. We do ask that you install a plugin for it called [Editor Config](https://editorconfig.org/). This plugin allows us to set some basic syntax standards across a wide range of languages for our team. It ensures basic syntax like tabs vs spaces (we use spaces) are set from the get go.

You can find our `.editorconfig` file in [our .editorconfig repository](https://github.com/Brandography/.editorconfig/). The easiest way to get this working is to add it in your home folder. All you have to do is run this command: `curl https://raw.github.com/Brandography/.editorconfig/master/.editorconfig > ~/.editorconfig`

## Project Management
### Trello
We use [Trello](https://trello.com) to manage projects and tasks. You will need a Trello account.

### Everhour
We use [Everhour](https://everhour.com) as our time tracker for projects and tasks. It integrates with Trello via a [browser extension](https://everhour.com/extensions).
