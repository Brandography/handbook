At Brandography, we have some of the best nerds around. We love [GIFs](https://media.giphy.com/media/tIjdrTgFkT3kig4DY0/giphy.gif), [dogs](https://cdnbrandog2-c7f.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Roufous-540x540-1.jpg), [tech news](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [beer](https://media1.giphy.com/media/4JOaSVSBUczAY/giphy.gif). If you're wondering what our developers do or might be interested in working on our team, here's how we work.

## Project Management
### Trello
We use [Trello](https://trello.com) to manage projects and tasks. You will need a Trello account.

### Everhour
We use [Everhour](https://everhour.com) as our time tracker for projects and tasks. It integrates with Trello via a [browser extension](https://everhour.com/extensions).
